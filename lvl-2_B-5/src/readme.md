-------------Interview Questions--------------------------------------------





1. Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript
----------------------------------------------------------------
Interfaces are extendable and used mainly for object shapes. Types are more flexible, supporting unions, primitives, and intersections. Interfaces support merging; types don’t. Both help structure data in TypeScript





2. Use of the keyof Keyword in TypeScript
-----------------------------------------------------
The keyof keyword returns a union of an object’s keys. It’s used for type-safe property access, ensuring that only existing keys can be referenced, reducing runtime errors and improving code safety.






3. Difference Between any, unknown, and never Types
-------------------------------------------------------
any disables type checks. unknown is safer—requires checks before use. never means a value that never occurs, like functions that throw errors. Use them wisely for safe and predictable code.




4. Use of Enums in TypeScript
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Enums define named constants. They improve code clarity and reduce errors. TypeScript supports numeric and string enums, commonly used for roles, states, or categories like weekdays or user types.






5. What is Type Inference in TypeScript?
---------------------------------------------------------
Type inference automatically determines a variable’s type based on its value. This reduces the need for manual annotations, improves code readability, and still gives strong type safety during development.









6. How Does TypeScript Improve Code Quality and Maintainability?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeScript catches errors early with static typing. It makes code easier to read, refactor, and maintain. It also supports better tooling, autocomplete, and documentation, leading to fewer bugs and cleaner projects.



7. Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types. Intersection types combine multiple types into one. Together, they offer flexibility and precision when modeling complex or varying data structures in applications.
